# ✅ Content Updates - Corrected Terminology

## Changes Made

### Issue Identified
The website incorrectly referred to GS Agritech as an "export company" in generic terms. This has been corrected to accurately reflect that:
- **GS Agritech exports bananas** (not a generic export company)
- **Clients import bananas** from GS Agritech (not export)

### ✅ Correct Usage:
- "GS Agritech exports bananas"
- "Banana exporter"
- "Exporting premium bananas to clients"
- "Your banana import journey" (client perspective)
- "Import premium bananas from us" (client action)

### ❌ Avoid:

- Generic export references without specifying bananas

## Perspective Clarity

- We are a **banana exporter**
- We provide **export services** for bananas

### Client's Perspective:
- They **import** bananas from us
- They are on an **import journey**
- They **buy/purchase** bananas from us

1. GS Agritech's specific business: **exporting bananas**
2. Client perspective: **importing bananas** from GS Agritech
3. Clear, specific terminology throughout all sections
